# boomer
TikTakBoom family board game - ruby adaptation for lengthy holidays with your boomer parents/grandparents.
The code herein is made for the Czech language (prompt, card spawning, ...). 

**Dependencies**
  - ruby
  - any .wav player (wavPlayer variable in main)

**Sounds**
I've included some free, rather crappy sounds from [freesoundeffects.com](https://www.freesoundeffects.com/), edited with Audacity; feel free to mess with it etc. etc.
