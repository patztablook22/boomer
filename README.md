# boomer
TikTakBum family board game - ruby adaptation for lengthy holidays with your boomer parents/grandparents.
The code herein is made for the Czech language (prompt, card spawning, ...). 

## Dependencies
  - ruby
  - any console .wav player (wavPlayer variable in main)

## Sounds
I've included some free, rather crappy sounds from [freesoundeffects.com](https://www.freesoundeffects.com/), edited with Audacity; feel free to mess with it etc. etc.
## Details?
Cards are being generated based on the pattern mode (vowels X consonants) and the weighted average of adequate letters based on the apx. Scrabble board game values.
Also, 6-sided dice are booooring, lets go non-Platonic.
